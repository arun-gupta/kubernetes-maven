= Kubernetes Maven Sample

This example will show how to deploy a Java application to a Kubernetes cluster using Maven.

== Working

. `mvn package`: Builds the WAR file
. `mvn exec:java`: Runs the application with a Couchbase server running on `localhost`

== Needs debugging

. `mvn fabric8:build`: Builds the Docker image and generated Kubernetes resources
. `mvn fabric8:resource`: Generates the Kubernetes configuration file in `target/classes/META-INF/fabric8` directory
. Set KUBERNETES_MASTER environment variable to point to the root of your kube cluster, ie `https://10.245.1.2`
. `mvn fabric8:apply`: Deploys the application to Kubernetes
